This project is sponsored by the Ohio Department of Agriculture (ODA) and the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) and supported by the Midwest Apple Foundation (MAF). 

The Ohio State University research team: Dr. Jessica Cooperstone, Dr. Diane Miller, Dr. Jonathan Fresnedo-Ramirez, Dr. Chris Simons, and hard-working graduate students (Lydia Balogh, MSc., and others).

After extensive food sensory testing on 32 apple selections, the purpose of this website is to publicly share the results of the taste, flavor, and texture attributes found for these selections. The attributes of these apples may be used to educate both growers and consumers about Ohio apples. 

For more information about the food sensory tests, please select 'Descriptive Analysis' or 'Consumer Testing' in the drop-down menu under 'About.'
